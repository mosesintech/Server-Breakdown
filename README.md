This is not production code, and it never should be.

I decided I needed to understand the inner workings of Knex.js better, and so I made a quick server with a simple API for two users. After trying a number of different organization methods, I found what I think is the most minimalistic way of using knex (which is not reader friendly at all, and so should never be used in production: Code is meant to be read by people AND interpreted by machines).

After I did this, I spun up a quick express server to play with a simple GET for all users. Then I realized I had some time, and a few GraphQL knowledge gaps, and so I added express-graphql to play around with it as well. 

I again took out all of the fluff so I can see exactly how the code works and what each function takes all on one page. I must say that I actually understand express-graphql much better now than I did before this exercise. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to learn GraphQL for the backend.

Ciao!
